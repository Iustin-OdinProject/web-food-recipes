        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is quick and easy and the kids will love it. Serve with lettuce, tomatoes, and the rest of the sour cream and cheese. Add salsa for a zing!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef </li>
            <li>3/4 cup water </li>
            <li>1 package taco seasoning mix </li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese, divided </li>
            <li>8 ounces sour cream, divided </li>
            <li>2 (8 ounce) packages refrigerated crescent rolls </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Mix water and taco seasoning mix into ground beef; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until water is evaporated, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Mix ground beef mixture, 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese, and 1/2 of the sour cream together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Roll crescent roll dough out onto a baking stone in the shape of a sunflower, with the triangle points pointing outward. Spread ground beef mixture onto dough in a circular shape. Wrap pointed end of dough around the beef mixture, sealing to the other end of dough making a ring-shape.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Serve alongside the remaining Cheddar cheese and sour cream.</li>
        </ol>
